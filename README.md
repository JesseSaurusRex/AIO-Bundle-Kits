All in One Bundle Kit Scanners for Vuse
View of scanners of Vuse's new "all in one" bundle kit.
Pulling from retail sales data using loyalty id card scanning at our retail partners (like a VIC or MVP card for grocery).
Using "regular scan behavior" as a loose indicator of readability for new, vs reactivated, vs active existing buyers of the brand, require minimum of one scan in the nicotine space per month over pre-period of interest.
Tracks device scanners over the next two months to look at subsequent purchases made by new, reactivated, and existing users of the brand.
Subsequent partner data pull of regular devices excluding these all in one bundle kits is used for comparison and evaluation of offer impact.
